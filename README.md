A game created with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
The game randomly generates prompts from an array, and randomly generates people from another array.
The number of people generated depends on the prompt (1-3 people). 
When you click on a WINNER button, the scores are updated, and a new prompt is generated. 
If the players cannot come to an agreement, they can click the "NEXT" button to generate a new prompt without awarding a point.
The name "Caiden" cannot be generated for Caiden (player). 
The name "Nico" cannot be generated for Nini (player).
